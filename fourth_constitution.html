<h1>Constitution of the Republic of Discordia</h1>

<h2>Preamble</h2>

<p>The Republic of Discordia is constituted as a federal republic of voluntarily united and equal peoples and a democratic community based on the powers of self-government to serve the common good. We, the Discordian people, commit ourselves to this Constitution:</p>

<p>Honoured of our national unity forged by Discordians from many nations;<br>
But profoundly aware of the imperative need to further consolidate our unity;<br>
Upholding freedom, tolerance, individual dignity and the rule of law;<br>
Proudly affirm ourselves as bastion for republicanism;<br>
And supportive of achievement as well as equality of opportunity for all.<br>
With this profound conviction, we, as a republic, do solemnly and wholeheartedly pledge our unwavering allegiance to this Constitution, a document that encapsulates the very essence of our republic's identity and aspirations.</p>
