    <h1>Impeachment Act, April 2024 </h1>
<p><b>Article I:</b> The judiciary retains the just authority to come to a verdict of the removal of a member of any publicly elected office, this is thus alluded to but not defined in the Anti-Corruption and Power Abuse Act, February 2024. The removal, referred to as an impeachment, requires a unanimous majority from the judiciary - upon the ruling of impeachment, the ruled against member is thereby impeached immediately from their office.</p>

<p><b>Article II:</b> In the event of a ruling, which pertains to the removal of any member of the presidium, the ruling must be ratified by a majority in parliament for the impeachment to be effectuated in an emergency vote. If successful, the member is thereby impeached immediately from their office.</p>

<p><b>Article III:</b> In the event of a presidium member who also bares responsibility to their respective branch other than the presidium that therefore holds a title pertaining to a position of lesser authority than the presidium do be impeached, their impeachment will be tried under the circumstances of the removal of a member of the presidium, but will also remove them from the office of the position of less authority.</p>

<p><b>Article IV:</b> If a member of the presidium who also resides in their respective branch other than the presidium is convicted of impeachment by the judiciary, the parliamentary vote is necessary for the removal from not only the presidium, but any elected position. Thus, the court cannot impeach a member from a branch of lesser authority without parliaments vote if the member is also elected to the presidium.</p>
