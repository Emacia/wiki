    <h1>Countback After Election Act, October 2023</h1>
<p>If there is a vacancy within 14 days of an election or by-election rather than holding another by-election, countback will be used instead. If the member was in a party then another member of that party shall be chosen. If there are no available members or the member was an independent, parliament will appoint an independent. An absolute majority will be needed to appoint the new member. </p>
