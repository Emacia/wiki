    <h1>Judicial Lawsuit Procedures Act, April 2024 </h1>
<p><b>Article I: Legal Definitions</b> When an individual, organisation or entity formally engages in a lawsuit, they shall be referred to as the “Prosecution”. The individual, organisation or entity who is being sued by the Prosecution shall be referred to as the “Defendant”.</p>

<p><b>Article II: Prosecution Procedures</b> The prosecution must notify the court its intention to sue an individual, organisation or entity when it is prepared to issue its complaint. The complaint shall contain the factual accusations against the defendant, including any evidence that the defence wishes to submit to the court that is reasonably expected to be discovered at the time of the complaint; this being evidence that is public, admissible and has occurred before the complaint was submitted before court. The complaint, shall contain the representation status of the prosecution, the allegations against the defendant and the recommended compensation or punishment. The prosecution must notify the defendant through private messages before issuing the complaint to the court. Once the prosecution has served the defendant their wishes to sue, whether communicated both sides or not, the court can open and begin judicial procedures.</p>

<p><b>Article III: Defence Procedures</b> Once the defendant has been served with the intention to sue by the prosecution, the prosecution will illustrate their case within the immediate creation of the court, the timing of the creation of the court and the immediate illustration shall be arranged upon between a justice and the prosecution. The defendant will be given a chance to confirm their representation status, argue against the allegations made or counter-claim, or even request the case to be dropped under conflicting or legal reasons. If the case is to continue, the defendant is given a 36 hour period to prepare their defence and any counter-claims they have made, this includes submitting evidence that would be reasonably discovered at the time of the defence’s preparation; this being evidence that is public, admissible and has occurred before the defence was submitted before court. The preparation shall also include their plea of guilty or not regarding the current case, and if counter-claiming, the necessary requirements for a counter-suit requisite to initiating a lawsuit as stated in the previous articles.
</p>

<p><b>Article IV: Evidentary</b> Falsified evidence, and any evidence that is obtained as stated in Article 31 of the constitution, is illegal against the court and is grounds for contempt of court. Evidence must be of a substantiative and relevant measure before the case in order for it to be admissible. If either the prosecution or defendant wishes to introduce evidence that occurred before either the complaint or defense, they must plead their case for the admission of this evidence before the court with reasonable justification as to why they did not submit it within their complaint or defence. If they discover evidence that took place after either their complaint or defense, they can contest to submit this new found evidence under the “substantial developing evidence” principle.
</p>

<p><b>Article V: Deliberation</b> Both the prosecution and the defence will be given ample opportunity to plead their case, ending with final statements once both sides have pled their case. The judiciary will then have 24 hours to deliberate on a ruling, and any compensation or punishment that is ruled shall commence immediately.</p>
