    <h1>Parliamentary Appointment for Vacancies Act, February 2024</h1>
<p>In line with previous legislation, if any sort of election has been held within 14 days prior to the vacancy being declared, then there shall be appointment. Otherwise there will be a by-election held.</p>
<p>Whatever party the vacant member was in prior to resigning will be the party to pick the new member. The party can pick anyone so long as they don't hold any other governmental position. The parliamentary leader shall declare the member with an absolute majority from the caucus needed to select the member.</p>
<p>If the member is the only member of their party or an independent, then in the case of resignation, they may select their successor. In the case of a motion of no confidence or the member not declaring a successor in parliament, parliament may choose an independent if they are an independent, or the party leader may select a new member.</p>
<p>In any circumstance if a party is unable to select a member within 72 hours, a by-election will be held that Friday.</p>
